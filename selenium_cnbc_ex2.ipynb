      "內容:\"I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future?\" so says billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his 2017 TED talk.For Musk, that means building a reality where humans live on multiple planets. \"And if we're not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future that we're going to have,\" Musk says.And when Musk thinks about the future, he does so like an engineer — practically, carefully and with a flow chart of probable outcomes.\"I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities. It's like a branching stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing,\" he says.Indeed, with his electric car company Tesla, his spacecraft company SpaceX and his tunneling venture The Boring Company, the tech entrepreneur is says he's helping shape the future.As everyone looks toward 2019, here are three predictions for the future from the entrepreneur.In November, Musk said it will be seven to 10 years until the first group of humans colonize Mars.In the same Twitter conversation, he said he imagines it will be \"engineers, artists and creatives of all kinds\" who will go to Mars first.The SpaceX founder and CEO said there is a \"70 percent\" chance that he himself will go to Mars, and that his space company \"recently made a number of breakthroughs that I am just really fired up about,\" he told Axios in November.It will be incredibly risky for those who go first to Mars, Musk said.\"It's gonna be hard, there's a good chance of death, going in a little can through deep space, you might land successfully, once you land successfully you'll be working non-stop to build the base — so not much time for leisure — and once you get there, even after all this, there's a very harsh environment, so there's a good chance you'll die there. We think you can come back but we're not sure,\" Musk told Axios.SpaceX aims to get an unmanned cargo rocket to Mars in 2024, according to Musk. \"Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there's a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this,\" Musk told Kara Swisher in October.As if Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company weren't enough to keep Musk busy, he also has a company, Neuralink, that is \"developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers,\" as the company's website explains.\"The long-term aspiration with Neuralink would be to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence…to achieve a sort of democratization of intelligence, such that it is not monopolistically held in a purely digital form by governments and large corporations,\" Musk told Axios in November.That will be done by connecting computer electrodes to neurons in your brain — \"a chip and a bunch of tiny wires\" that will be \"implanted in your skull,\" Musk said.\"I believe this can be done. ... It's probably on the order of a decade,\" he said.If the idea of your intelligence being enhanced by computers seems wild, Musk says it's starting now: \"And by the way, you kind of have this already in a weird way: You have a digital tertiary layer in the form of your phone, your computers, your watch. You basically have these computing devices that form a tertiary layer on your cognition already,\" Musk said, according to Axios.Musk has been pulling an insane schedule, working as many as 120 hours in a week, to get the Model 3 Tesla production ramped up, but he's already touting new products.\"I'm dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year,\" he tweeted in December.Musk has been relatively vague about the specifics of the truck — \"Well I can't talk about the details,\" he told Swisher — but he was unabashed in expressing his own excitement.\"We've got the pickup truck, which — actually, I'm personally most excited about the pickup truck,\" Musk told Swisher in October. \"It's gonna be like a really futuristic like cyberpunk, 'Blade Runner' pickup truck.\"He continued: \"It's gonna be awesome, it's gonna be amazing. … This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It's like, oh, it's great.\"The Tesla boss says he isn't particularly confident that there will be a large number of people who want to buy the first, ultra-futuristic version of the truck he has been dreaming about. If his design is not popular, then Tesla will make a more traditional truck body, he says.\"It's like I really wanted something that's like super-futuristic cyberpunk. Which, if it doesn't ... if I'm weirdly like ... if there's only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we'll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it's the thing that I am personally most fired up about. It's gonna have a lot of titanium,\" Musk told Swisher.See also:Elon Musk: 'Robots will be able to do everything better than us'Ahead of Elon Musk, this self-made millionaire already launched a company to merge your brain with computersElon Musk: This is why I push myself to the brinkLike this story?

      "內容:North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday that his resolve for complete denuclearization remains unchanged but he may have no option but to seek a \"new path\" if the United States continues to demand unilateral action from North Korea.In his New Year address, Kim said there would be faster progress on denuclearization if the United States takes corresponding action. He added that he is willing to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at any time to produce results that the international community would welcome.North Korea however would have \"no option but to explore a new path in order to protect our sovereignty\" if the United States \"miscalculates our people's patience, forces something upon us and pursues sanctions and pressure without keeping a promise it made in front of the world,\" Kim said.It was not clear what \"new path\" the North Korean leader was referring to.Kim and Trump vowed to work towards denuclearization and build a \"lasting and stable\" peace regime at their landmark summit in Singapore in June, but both sides have since been struggling to make progress.Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps toward denuclearization, including dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility.Kim also called for South Korea to \"completely stop\" joint military drills with the United States involving strategic assets, while multilateral negotiations should be pursued to build a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\"Now that North and South Korea decided on the path of peace and prosperity, we insist that joint military exercises with outside forces should no longer be allowed and deployment of war weapons such as outside strategic assets should be completely stopped,\" Kim said.\n",

      "內容:This volatile market year was full of historical milestones and the end of the year will be no different for a key stock index.For the first time ever, the S&P 500 will end the year with a loss after being positive for the first three quarters. The benchmark index was up 9 percent through the first three quarters of the year. Then the October sell-off began. The S&P 500 fell 7 percent in October and accelerated those losses this month, in what is likely to be the index's worst December performance since the Great Depression.Read More: Here are the best and worst performing stocks of this tough and volatile year for the marketThe S&P 500 is set to end 2018 down nearly 7 percent.

      "內容:Wall Street concluded a tumultuous 2018 on Monday as the major stock indexes posted their worst yearly performances since the financial crisis.After solid gains on Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 6.2 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, for 2018. Both indexes logged in their biggest annual losses since 2008, when they plunged 38.5 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.9 percent in 2018, its worst year in a decade, when it dropped 40 percent.The S&P 500 and Dow fell for the first time in three years, while the Nasdaq snapped a six-year winning streak. 2018 was a year fraught with volatility, characterized by record highs and sharp reversals. This year also marks the first time ever the S&P 500 posts a decline after rising in the first three quarters.For the quarter, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq plunged 13.97 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively, their worst quarterly performances since the fourth quarter of 2008. The Dow notched its worst period since the first quarter of 2009, falling nearly 12 percent.A sizable chunk of this quarter's losses came during a violent December. The indexes all dropped at least 8.7 percent for the month. The Dow and S&P 500 also recorded their worst December performance since 1931 and their biggest monthly loss since February 2009.Investors dumped stocks this month amid concerns of an economic slowdown and fears the Federal Reserve might be making a monetary policy mistake. Concern over ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U.S. have also pressured stocks this month.But that doesn't explain just how wild a ride December was for investors. At its low price on Christmas Eve, the S&P 500 was down more than 20 percent from its record high on an intraday basis, briefly meeting the requirement for a bear market. The stock market would come soaring back in the next session, with the Dow jumping more than 1,000 points on Dec. 26, its biggest ever point gain.Traders had trouble pinpointing the cause of the extreme volatility, with some chalking it up to computer-driven trading.The major averages trimmed some of their sharp annual losses on Monday on hopes of trade progress between China and the U.S. The Dow climbed 265 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both gained 0.8 percent.John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said these declines are \"setting the stage for upward surprises in 2019.\"\"With what we believe to be almost all but the kitchen sink priced into current valuations, we see opportunity for multiples to return to levels seen at the end of the third quarter … with multiple expansions resulting in a global equity rebound in the coming year,\" Stoltzfus wrote in a note.\"That said, we do not expect a rally of great significance to emerge until sometime into the first quarter of 2019. We look for market risk to weigh on investor sentiment into the new year until catalysts for a rally of some material significance appear on the scene,\" he added.Merck shares rose more than 1 percent, ending the year as the best-performing Dow component of 2018. Pfizer, the second best performer on the Dow this year, also climbed 1.6 percent on Monday. Netflix jumped 4.5 percent while Amazon rose 1 percent after the popular FAANG trade (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet) took a beating recently.President Donald Trump said this weekend he had a \"very good call\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss trade. The president also claimed that \"big progress\" was being made on this front. Trump's statements sparked gains in markets worldwide.However, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump may be overstating how much progress was being made. The report cited people familiar with the situation. China and the U.S. agreed earlier this month to a 90-day grace period to try and work out their differences on trade.\"The threat of an escalating trade war has chilled US business confidence, with managers uncertain as to if/how they should restructure global supply chains,\" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients.\"The most bullish case here is that the tariff issue will be settled in Q1 2019, and a meaningful resolution should be enough to trigger a first half rally for stocks,\" Colas added. \"Against that optimistic take are two bearish outcomes: one, that these negotiations take longer and two, that they fail outright.\"—CNBC's Spriha Srivastava contributed to this report.\n",
